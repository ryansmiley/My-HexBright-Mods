Hexbright Factory Mod

I am not really a programmer, but I started with the factory default app and modified it from the there.
The flashlight button will click through low, medium, high then back down and up if the next press occurs within a second.
It will also remember its last state and use that when it turns on.
If you hold down the button for 2 seconds(ish) the flashlight will dazzle strobe.
While the strobe is on, you can change the blink to SOS morse code. To do this tap the flashlight while strobe is active. Click the button to turn off.
The code isnt pretty, as you cant use a delay because that ignores button presses. 
A future mod will be a 5 button press (with 2 seconds) to lock and release the lock with green button flash indication.
