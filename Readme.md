Hexbright Factory Mod

I am not really a programmer, but I modified the factory default app to function more to my liking.
It now will click through low, medium, and bright settings if the next press occurs within a second.
Also if you hold down the button for 2 seconds (ish) the flashlight is dazzle strobe.
While the strobe is on, you can change the blink to SOS morse code. To do this tap the flashlight while strobe is active. Click the button to turn off.
The code isnt pretty as you cant use a delay, because that ignores button presses. 
A future mod will be a 5 button press (with 2 seconds) to lock and release the lock with green button flash indication.
